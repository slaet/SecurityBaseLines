all about the Security baselines in Intune

All Baselines from Intune Security Baselines are uploaded as seperate files, for Windows, Defender, Office 365 Apps and EDGE.
Some settings are older, because the Baselines dosn't allow a newer Version.
The Windows Settings are for Windows 11 24H2, part are from the 23H2 baseline, and added the difference of it, from the Sec.-Baseline Excel spreadsheet with the latest baseline settings from microsoft.
Office Baseline and EDGE will follow later, the jason files to integrate it to Intune already here, but not documented.

For the Missing CSP settings, that are not realy exist today, are in a detection and remidiation script to import as remediation script in intune, will fill that gap.
(if you want you can also create config profiles with OMA-URI settings, because the CSP on the OS are there, but not as a setting in the setting catalog in Intune)
