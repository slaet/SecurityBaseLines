# SecurityBaseLines
all about the Security baselines in Intune

All Baselines from Intune Security Baselines are uploaded as seperate files, for Windows, Defender, Office 365 Apps and EDGE.
Some settings are older, because the Baselines dosn't allow a newer Version.
The Windows Settings are for Windows 11 24H2, part are from the 23H2 baseline, and added the difference of it, from the Sec.-Baseline Excel spreadsheet with the latest baseline settings from microsoft.
